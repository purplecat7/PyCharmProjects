Nosetests may be run from the command line or from PyCharm run configuration.
1 - command line:
    nosetests <target>
    where 'target' may be a files, module or specific test
    (see http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html)

2 - PyCharm:
    Choose Run->Edit Configurations (or use the run/debug selection dropdown) to display dialogue.
    Add a new PythonTests -> nosetests configuration.
    Set the target, interpreter and working directory, and save with a sensible name.
    Optionally use '--nocapture' in additional arguments if you have print statements in the tests which you would like to see in the console.

Logging
There are standard logging options which are part of nosetests, but there is also a plugin which provides more flexibility: http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/logcapture.html
EMail alerts
One can override the nosetest.TestResult implementation to send emails on failure

Or we should use a CI server such as Jenkins/Travis
