# Generate shape name strings:
# the 'yield' keyword determines that this function is a generator and it
# actually returns a generator object that has an iterator.
# This iterator is implicitly used in the for statement, so it appears that
# you are iterating through the generator function, not what it returns.
# This was done for convenience of use.

# Thus, the code that you write is actually a kind of factory,
# that creates the generator objects that do the actual generation.
# You can use the generator explicitly if you want, for example:
#   gen = shapeNameGen(7)
#   print(gen.next())

# So next() is the iterator method thatâ€™s actually called to generate the
# next object, and it takes no arguments. shapeNameGen( ) is the factory,
# and gen is the generator.
def shapeNameGen(n):
    types = Shape.__subclasses__()
    for i in range(n):
        yield random.choice(types).__name__

# generators are a bit odd! the shapeNameGen(7) is not an initialisation
shapes = [ Shape.factory(i) for i in shapeNameGen(7)]
